## Usage ideas

mserv new Test --dir C: --software purpur --version 1.20.2 --ram 8192
--> Infos auflisten, y/n

mserv delete [NAME]
--> Infos auflisten wenn Instanz gefunden, y/n

mserv list -d
--> Alle Instanzen auflisten
--> -d -> Detailreiche Ausgabe

mserv start [NAME]
--> Instanz starten

mserv edit [NAME]
--> Instanz bearbeiten (RAM, Name, Storage directory), y/n

## Polishing ideas
Make the user aware of the actual storage location (C:\Users\[USER]\Desktop\[CONFIG_NAME])
Make sure the directory that's trying to be created does not exist

## Implementation improvement ideas
- Handle Exceptions through an ErrorHandler class to make frontend more independent of backend
- Make it possible to run server instances in the background with additional flag, so the terminal in- and output is not blocked. Use redirect Output to file.
Also, maybe make it possible to then to enter the instance output and input through tool.
- Change command line argument parsing, since it has many possible bugs (Instance names with spaces don't work correctly) - maybe use library
- notification system display maybe has to be change when later implementing gui
- Make the ServerInstanceManager handle the entire server setup up process, not other way around, so the setup process can be aborted and cleaned up
